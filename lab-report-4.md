# week 6 & 7 lab report!

## Part 1: using Vim
### Task: In ```DocSearchServer.java```, change the name of the ```start``` parameter of ```getFiles```, and all of its uses, to instead be called ```base```.


1. ```git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/skill-demo1 week6-skill-demo1 <Enter>```

2. ```cd week6-skill-demo1 <Enter>```

3. ```vim DocSearchServer.java <Enter>```

4. ```/start <Enter>```

## Part 2: Vim vs VSCode
- using VSCode to edit took 1:44
- using VIM took 1:50
- both runs had a couple retypes and human error, but had roughly the same amount

If I had to work on a program that was running remotely, I would probably go witg using the VSCode way because I feel like for large edits Vim could get inefficient, especially if there are several files involved.
